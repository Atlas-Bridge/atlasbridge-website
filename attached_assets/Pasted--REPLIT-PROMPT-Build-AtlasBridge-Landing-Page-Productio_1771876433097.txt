# REPLIT PROMPT — Build AtlasBridge Landing Page (Production-grade, Brand-correct)

You are building a **static marketing landing page** for a software project called **AtlasBridge**.

## ✅ Goals
Create a clean, enterprise-grade landing page that:
- Looks credible to engineering leaders and security/compliance teams
- Uses AtlasBridge’s official brand system (colors/typography)
- Uses the provided logo assets (already available in the project)
- Is appropriate for all audiences: **DV-safe, business-safe, non-emotional, non-political**
- Avoids hype language, avoids “AI magic” claims
- Includes compliance-friendly wording (ISO 27001 / SOC2 *aligned* posture) **without making unverifiable certification claims**

## 🚫 Hard Rules
- Do **NOT** claim “ISO 27001 certified” or “SOC2 certified” unless explicitly backed by evidence.
- You may say “designed to support compliance workflows” or “supports auditability” but avoid legal promises.
- Do **NOT** mention weapons, politics, personal life, DV, or anything sensitive.
- Do **NOT** add tracking scripts, cookies, analytics, or external fonts unless requested.
- Keep everything static (no backend). Login button is a placeholder only.

## Brand System (Must Apply)
### Colors
- Primary (Atlas Navy): `#0B2A3C`
- Dark background (Deep Control Navy): `#071D2B`
- Light background (Foundation Light): `#F5F7F9`
- Secondary neutral (Bridge Slate): `#6E7A86`
- Accent (Governance Teal): `#1F8A8C` (use sparingly)
- Status (muted): Success `#1E7E34`, Warning `#C77D00`, Danger `#A4161A`

### Typography
- Use system font stack that matches Inter feel (no external fetch):
  - `font-family: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji";`
- Monospace for code blocks:
  - `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New", monospace`

### Visual Style
- Minimal, infrastructure-grade, calm.
- No futuristic blobs, no neon gradients, no cartoon imagery.
- Subtle hero background gradient is okay: `#071D2B → #0B2A3C` (very subtle).

## Required Page Sections (Information Architecture)
### 1) Header (Top Navigation)
- Left: AtlasBridge logo (use primary logo for light mode OR white version for dark header)
- Navigation links: Overview, How it Works, Security, Docs, Roadmap
- Top right: Buttons:
  - Primary: “View Docs”
  - Secondary: “Login” (top-right, not top-left)
- Also include a “Login” entry in top nav.  
**Note:** user asked “login button at top left” — implement BOTH:
- A small “Login” link at top-left near logo (for the requirement)
- And a clearer button at top-right for UX

Login button behavior: link to `/login` placeholder route OR `#login` section (no backend).

### 2) Hero Section
Headline (H1):
- “Controlled Autonomy for AI Agents”
Subheadline:
- “AtlasBridge is a deterministic governance runtime that supervises AI CLI agents with policy-driven execution, structured escalation, and audit-grade traceability.”
CTAs:
- “Get Started” (scrolls to Install section)
- “View Documentation” (links to docs URL placeholder)

Hero Visual:
- Use a static mock terminal card + a “Policy Decision Trace” card
- Include small labels: “Deterministic evaluation”, “Append-only audit log”, “Local execution”

### 3) What It Is / What It Is Not
Two-column layout:
- What it is:
  - Deterministic governance runtime
  - Policy DSL
  - Human escalation
  - Audit trail + trace
- What it is not:
  - Not a cloud execution platform
  - Not a ChatGPT clone
  - Not remote-control automation
  - Not a SaaS product (for now)

### 4) How It Works (3–5 steps)
Use numbered steps with minimal text and icons (simple SVG).
Steps should reflect the invariant: Cloud observes, local executes.

### 5) Security & Compliance Posture (Careful Wording)
Title: “Security & Compliance Alignment”
Include bullet points phrased safely:
- “Designed to support auditability and evidence collection.”
- “Policy-governed execution with deterministic evaluation.”
- “Append-only audit trail with integrity verification.”
- “Local-first execution boundary (no remote execution by default).”
- “Supports security review workflows (e.g., ISO 27001 / SOC 2 aligned controls), depending on your deployment and operational processes.”
Add disclaimer line:
- “Compliance outcomes depend on your environment, controls, and operating procedures.”

### 6) Features Grid (Core capabilities)
Cards:
- Policy-driven autonomy modes (Off / Assist / Full)
- Structured escalation
- Deterministic prompt classification
- Audit log integrity chain
- Replay / simulation (if applicable, else say “Roadmapped”)
- Operator console / dashboard (read-only)

### 7) Installation / Quick Start (Static)
Show code blocks:
- `pip install atlasbridge`
- `atlasbridge setup --channel telegram`
- `atlasbridge run claude`
Do not include secrets. Add warning: “Never paste tokens into public logs.”

### 8) Roadmap Preview
Show 4 roadmap bullets:
- v1.0 GA hard freeze
- Deterministic replay (pre-GA)
- Policy debug mode (pre-GA)
- Observe-only cloud path (post-GA, design only)

### 9) Footer
- Links: GitHub, Docs, Security, License
- Small disclaimer:
  - “AtlasBridge is local-first. Cloud features are observe-only by design.”

## Accessibility + UX Requirements
- Must be responsive (mobile-first).
- Support dark mode (CSS only).
- Good contrast ratios.
- Use semantic HTML, ARIA labels for nav and buttons.
- No motion-heavy animations. If any animation: subtle fade-in only.

---

## Technical Requirements
- Use **Next.js (App Router)** OR **Vite + React** OR plain HTML/CSS (choose simplest).
- Prefer: **Vite + React + TypeScript** (simple to run).
- No external dependencies unless necessary.
- No backend.
- Provide clear instructions in README for running locally:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`

---

## Assets
The project already contains AtlasBridge logo files.
You must:
- Inspect the `/assets` (or similar) directory
- Use:
  - Primary logo (light)
  - White logo (dark)
  - Icon-only for favicon
- Implement favicon set references in `<head>`:
  - 16x16, 32x32, 180x180, 512x512

---

## Output Deliverables
1) Complete landing page implementation
2) Dark mode + light mode
3) Responsive design
4) Placeholder `/login` page or login modal (static)
5) Favicon wiring
6) README with run instructions

Build it now.
